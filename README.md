# FilmCrewApp
A social Networking Platform for filmakers, actors, and crews to collaborate, build their skills, build their portfolios and get hired in the film and TV industries. 
# Background
Careers in film and TV are difficult to get. Statistics state that five of the top ten careers with the highest national unemployment rate are in the film and TV industries. This information does not include the large number of individuals who attained employment in other areas due to limited opportunities. Causes of the problem include:
. Weak networks - Unless one already has extensive experience in their field,the only connections will be fellow classmates and professors, and that is if the attended a formal program. Professors can help, but the reach is limited. When it comes to peers, unfortunately, many fellow graduates are in the same position,  likely also considering, if not already in the process of taking employment in other areas. It is difficult to focus on collaborations in the capacity they once did in school, once the reality of post college adulthood sets in. For ones who don't have the experience nor the formal education, it may be even more difficult - since they need to start from square one and learn many of the technical skills on their own.
. Location - Although it is possible to get a job in entertainment in one's local community - To have the highest probability of attaining employment one will likely need to relocate to a strategic location where film and tv production is constant, like Los Angeles, New York, or Atlanta. Without preparation, the job seeker is setting his/herself up for failure.
. Few employment opportunities - Aware of the shortage, many people already employed keep their job for longer. Their experiences and reputations keep them employed, while keeping others without said experience from getting their foot in the door.
. Portfolio - There is no set and streamlined system to organize and share one's work.  
. References - Without experience, there is no concrete way of verifying one's ability to carry out needed tasks.
Opportunity to collaborate, contacts, a portfolio of work, and references maximise one's chances of getting a paid job in the film and tv industries; the FilmCrewApp provides solution for each of these problems.
# User Profile 
Users are able to create public profiles accessible to all searching in the desired vicinity. Profile will include photograps, some personal information, desired skills, and skills offered. 
# Chat
Users will be able to reach out to one another and great TEAMS via chat. The chat would allow real time communication between members of the crews. Once the projects are completed, the chats may be deleted.
# Portfolio
Users are able to create a portfolio, so possible collaborators can view the user's work. User can upload videos and photographs as evidence of their work, as we as a questionnaire with details about the work. Details will include dates, a description, and role.
# Project Creation
The user who initiates the collaboration creates a project that is linked to all collaborators in the project. All collaborators can post to the project, but the project manager (creator) is the only one who can delete files from it. Notes, videos, and photos may be added to the project and are visible on the profiles of all collaborators.
# Review System
Upon completion of a project, the project manager closes the project and collaborators are able to review one another on a 5 star rating and a short justification in a text box. Reviewers will also be asked to check whether or not they would collaborate with the user again.
